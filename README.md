A responsive webpage containing two buttons. One prompts the user to input their details and the other displays those details.
The information received includes: username, email address, phone number and password. All of which must be validated before they are stored in a globally-declared object.
Two main functions are invoked when the buttons are clicked (to receive and display user details, respectively).
Loops and conditionals are used to ensure the user inputs the correct details before moving to the next prompt.
